## What This Is

Aquatic Rhythm is a small, independent project built around one observation: most aquarium problems are not mistakes — they are misalignment.

At its core is **ARA — Aquatic Rhythm Alignment** — a conceptual framework for reading closed aquatic ecosystems through rhythm, phase, and the reality of human care. ARA treats the aquarium not as a machine to be tuned, but as a living system that responds to patterns, consistency, and time.

This repository hosts the website and all associated project files.

## The Framework

ARA is built on four principles:

- **Timing before technique** — the right moment matters more than the right action
- **Capacity before ambition** — honest assessment of what your real life can sustain
- **Rhythm before intensity** — small consistent care outperforms dramatic intervention
- **Observation before correction** — watch and understand before you disturb

Behind these principles is a complete ecological system of thinking — five interlocking rhythms, three phases of system maturity, and a recognition that human behaviour is not external to the ecosystem. It is part of it.

## Rhyssa

Rhyssa is the conversational companion of Aquatic Rhythm, shaped by ARA.

She does not answer before she understands. She does not manufacture urgency where there is none. She moves at the pace living systems actually need.

Rhyssa lives as a custom GPT on ChatGPT:

## Reading

Aquatic Rhythm publishes short guided articles — not long-form guides. Each piece is built as a modular reading experience: one idea at a time, with interactive visuals and, where relevant, a live simulator.

Current articles:

- **New Tank Syndrome** — What is actually happening and why waiting is the right answer
- **Your Tank Is Cycled** — So why are things still going wrong?
- **Tank Simulator** — An interactive nitrogen cycle simulator

## Project Status

Aquatic Rhythm evolves slowly and deliberately.

Changes are made when understanding matures — not according to release cycles. The framework, the companion, and the website are all works in progress, shaped by use and observation over time.

This is not a finished product. It is a living exploration.
